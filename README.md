# Rope-data-structure-with-better-visualization
I was learning rope data structure then after 3 days I learned it, but I realise it was very badly visualized in my opinion so i made another diagram please check below



## [Wikipedia Visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope_(data_structure)) - Bad in my opinion
